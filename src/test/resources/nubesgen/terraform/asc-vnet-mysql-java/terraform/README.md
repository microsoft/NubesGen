## Running Terraform

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is used to automate infrastructure configuration.

As you didn't select the [NubesGen GitOps option](https://github.com/microsoft/NubesGen/blob/main/docs/gitops-overview.md),
you need to install and run Terraform manually.

- Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) for your platform.
- Install the [Azure CLI](https://aka.ms/nubesgen-install-az-cli) and authenticate using `az login`
- In the current directory, initialize Terraform: `terraform init`
- Apply the current Terraform configuration: `terraform apply`

Once your Terraform configuration has been applied, you can go to the [Azure Portal](https://aka.ms/nubesgen-portal) to check your resources.
