## Running the bicep code
{{^gitops}}

You can run the bicep code directly with the [Azure CLI](https://aka.ms/nubesgen-install-az-cli). 
Make sure to have an up to date version - bicep support may not be present on older versions - and authenticate using `az login`.

You can deploy your infrastructure with the following command:

```shell
az deployment sub create --name '{{applicationName}}{{environment}}' --location {{location}} --template-file main.bicep
```
{{/gitops}}
