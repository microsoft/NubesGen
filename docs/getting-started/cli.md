# Getting started with NubesGen CLI

[[toc]]

## Install the CLI

### Prerequisites

:::tip
You can go to [https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com) and login with the Azure subscription you want to use. This will provide you with the 
mandatory prerequisites below (Bash, Azure CLI, and GitHub CLI).
:::

For the CLI to work, you need to have installed and configured the following tools:

- [Bash](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne-Again_shell), which is installed by default on most Linux distributions and on Mac OS X. If you're using Windows, one solution is to use [WSL](https://aka.ms/nubesgen-install-wsl).
- [Azure CLI](https://aka.ms/nubesgen-install-az-cli). To login, use `az login`.
- (optional) [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/). To login, use `gh auth login`. This will automate creating the GitHub secrets for you, otherwise you will need to do it manually.

### Downloading and installing the CLI

This CLI is available as a native image on major platforms (Linux, Mac OS, Windows), and as a Java archive. The Java archive will run everywhere, but
requires a Java Virtual Machine.

Releases are available on GitHub at [https://github.com/microsoft/nubesgen/releases](https://github.com/microsoft/nubesgen/releases) and in the following examples we will use the GitHub CLI to download them.

::: details Downloading and installing the CLI with Java
   
To run the Java archive, you need to have a Java Virtual Machine (version 11 or higher) installed.

- Download the latest release: `gh release download --repo microsoft/nubesgen --pattern='nubesgen-cli-*.jar'`
- Run the binary: `java -jar nubesgen-*.jar -h`

::: details Downloading and installing the CLI on Linux
   
To run the binary on Linux, you need to:

- Download the latest release: `gh release download --repo microsoft/nubesgen --pattern='nubesgen-cli-linux'`
- Make the binary executable: `chmod +x nubesgen-cli-linux`
- Run the binary: `./nubesgen-cli-linux -h`

:::
::: details Downloading and installing the CLI on a Mac OS

   To run the binary on a Mac OS, you need to:

   - Download the latest release: `gh release download --repo microsoft/nubesgen --pattern='nubesgen-cli-macos'`
   - Make the binary executable: `chmod +x nubesgen-cli-macos`
   - Allow Mac OS X to execute it: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine nubesgen-cli-macos`
   - Run the binary: `./nubesgen-cli-macos -h`

:::
::: details Downloading and installing the CLI on Windows

   To run the binary on Windows, you need to:

   - Download the latest release: `gh release download --repo microsoft/nubesgen --pattern='nubesgen-cli-windows.exe'`
   - Run the binary: `nubesgen-cli-windows -h`

## Using the CLI

_Use the `-h` option with the CLI to have a complete and up-to-date help page_

- Running the CLI without any arguments (e.g. `./nubesgen-cli-linux`) will run the most common sub-commands in a logical order. This will setup GitOps, scan your project to find the technologies used, and download the Infrastructure as Code configuration from the NubesGen REST server.
- The `projectname` sub-command (e.g. `./nubesgen-cli-linux projectname`) will create a unique project name to be used inside Azure. It will take the first 8 letters of the name of your current directory, and add two random numbers.
- The `scan` sub-command (e.g. `./nubesgen-cli-linux scan`) will scan your project to find the technologies used. It will use those technologies to generate a REST request String that can be sent to the NubesGen REST server.
- The `gitops` sub-command (e.g. `./nubesgen-cli-linux gitops`) will setup GitOps for the current project.
- The `download` sub-command (e.g. `./nubesgen-cli-linux download`) will download a default Infrastructure as Code configuration from the NubesGen REST server.
