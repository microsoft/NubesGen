## üõ°Ô∏è Security issues

:::danger WATCH AHEAD
**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**
:::

Even if NubesGen does not manipulate personal information, all code can be used to create complex attacks. We're working with security in mind, but we assume a few things: 

- We can trust the templates in the GitHub repository
- People are using the hosted (at nubesgen.com) version
- The CLI or scripts that manipulate your Azure credentials are executed in a safe environment.

That being said, we still can have security issues in NubesGen. 

**If you have a _small_ security concern**, please ping one of the two core maintainers on Twitter **only via direct messages**. This should **not** be used if you need to exchange personal/account data.

- [Christopher Maneu](https://twitter.com/cmaneu)

**If the issue is more _serious_ or if you don't have/want to use Twitter**, please follow Microsoft Open source security as listed in [security.md](https://github.com/microsoft/nubesgen/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
