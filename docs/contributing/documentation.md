# Contributing to NubesGen documentation

NubesGen documentation is quite a new component of NubesGen. We welcome very much any contribution here ðŸ˜‡.

The documentation code is in the [docs](https://github.com/microsoft/NubesGen/tree/main/docs) directory of the main project.

## Building the doc locally

You can build the doc locally with dev mode by executing `npm run docs:dev`. By default, the website will appear on port `8080`.
Please note that GitHub buttons are **not** rendered locally.
