# GitOps with NubesGen quick start

## Introduction

When using GitOps, Terraform will use [an Azure backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/azurerm.html) to lock its state while it is being updated, as several GitHub Actions runs can occur in parallel.

This makes this setup far more robust than running Terraform manually, but adds a bit more complexity, as a specific resource group and a specific storage account need to created.

The following steps will guide you through creating those resources, and authorizing GitHub Actions to perform Azure resource management on your behalf.

## Configure GitOps in 5 steps

_Prerequisites_

:::tip
You can go to [https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com) and login with the Azure subscription you want to use. This will provide you with the 
mandatory prerequisites below (Bash, Azure CLI, and GitHub CLI).
:::

For setting up GitOps (using the NubesGen CLI or the manual installation), you need to have installed and configured the following tools:

- [Bash](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne-Again_shell), which is installed by default on most Linux distributions and on Mac OS X. If you're using Windows, one solution is to use [WSL](https://aka.ms/nubesgen-install-wsl).
- [Azure CLI](https://aka.ms/nubesgen-install-az-cli). To login, use `az login`.
- (optional) [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/). To login, use `gh auth login`. This will automate creating the GitHub secrets for you, otherwise you will need to do it manually.

### Automatic Installation (with the NubesGen CLI)

::: tip
Full documentation for the NubesGen CLI is available [here](../cli/README.md).
:::

1. Create a GitHub repository to work in (or select one that you already created), and clone it on your local computer.
1. Open up a terminal in the repository you just cloned, and setup GitOps using the NubesGen CLI:
::: details Installing and running the CLI with Java
   
   To run the Java archive, you need to have a Java Virtual Machine (version 11 or higher) installed.

   - Download the latest release: `gh release download --repo microsoft/nubesgen --pattern='nubesgen-cli-*.jar'`
   - Setup GitOps: `java -jar nubesgen-*.jar gitops`
:::

::: details Installing and running the CLI on Linux
   
   To run the binary on Linux, you need to:

   - Download the latest release: `gh release download --repo microsoft/nubesgen --pattern='nubesgen-cli-linux'`
   - Make the binary executable: `chmod +x nubesgen-cli-linux`
   - Setup GitOps: `./nubesgen-cli-linux gitops`

:::
::: details Installing and running the CLI on a Mac OS

   To run the binary on a Mac OS, you need to:

   - Download the latest release: `gh release download --repo microsoft/nubesgen --pattern='nubesgen-cli-macos'`
   - Make the binary executable: `chmod +x nubesgen-cli-macos`
   - Allow Mac OS X to execute it: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine nubesgen-cli-macos`
   - Setup GitOps: `./nubesgen-cli-macos gitops`

:::
::: details Installing and running the CLI on Windows

   To run the binary on Windows, you need to:

   - Download the latest release: `gh release download --repo microsoft/nubesgen --pattern='nubesgen-cli-windows.exe'`
   - Setup GitOps; `nubesgen-cli-windows gitops`

:::

   To learn more about the NubesGen CLI, [read the project documentation here](../cli/README.md), or run the CLI using the `-h` flag.
   
   If you do not want to use the CLI beyond this setup, you can safely delete it after this step.
1. Go to [https://nubesgen.com/](https://nubesgen.com/) to create your Terraform configuration, and select the `GitOps` option. Download the generated file and unzip it inside the Git repository you have just cloned.
1. You can now push the NubesGen code to your repository, for example by typing `git add . && git commit -m 'Configure GitOps with NubesGen' && git push`.
1. To use the new GitOps features, follow [GitOps overview](gitops-overview.md) and create a specific branch, for example
   `git checkout -b env-test && git push --set-upstream origin env-test`

### Manual Installation (without the NubesGen CLI)

::: details This setup only replaces step 2 of the automatic installation, described above (click to expand)

Instead of running the NubesGen CLI, you will manually create one Azure Storage account, and two GitHub secrets.

Here is the shell script you will need to execute, with documentation for each command being executed:

```bash
#####
# Configure the following environment variables to suit your needs.
#####
# The resource group used by Terraform to store its remote state.
RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=rg-terraform-001
# The location of the resource group. For example `eastus`.
LOCATION=eastus
# The storage account (inside the resource group) used by Terraform to store its remote state.
TF_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=st$RANDOM$RANDOM$RANDOM$RANDOM
# The container name (inside the storage account) used by Terraform to store its remote state.
CONTAINER_NAME=tfstate
#####
# Execute the following commands to set up GitOps.
#####
# Create a new Azure Resource Group
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --location $LOCATION
# Create the storage account
az storage account create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $TF_STORAGE_ACCOUNT --sku Standard_LRS --allow-blob-public-access false --encryption-services blob
# Get the storage account key
ACCOUNT_KEY=$(az storage account keys list --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --account-name $TF_STORAGE_ACCOUNT --query '[0].value' -o tsv)
# Create a blob container
az storage container create --name $CONTAINER_NAME --account-name $TF_STORAGE_ACCOUNT --account-key $ACCOUNT_KEY
# Get the subscription ID
SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id --output tsv --only-show-errors)
# Create a service principal
SERVICE_PRINCIPAL=$(az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID" --sdk-auth --only-show-errors)
# Get the current GitHub remote repository
REMOTE_REPO=$(git config --get remote.origin.url)
# Set the two GitHub secrets
gh secret set AZURE_CREDENTIALS -b"$SERVICE_PRINCIPAL" -R $REMOTE_REPO && gh secret set TF_STORAGE_ACCOUNT -b"$TF_STORAGE_ACCOUNT" -R $REMOTE_REPO
```

__Congratulations, you have set up GitOps with NubesGen on your project!__

## Using the GitOps workflow

As described in the [GitOps overview](gitops-overview.md), each time you create an `env-*` branch in Git, a new environment will be created for you.

That environment is an Azure resource group, containing all the resources configured with Terraform. When that environment is created, and each time you `git push` to that branch, two things will happen:

- The GitHub Action will apply the current Terraform configuration, so that your Azure resource group is synchronized with the configuration store in Git.
- The GitHub Action will then package and deploy the code stored in the Git branch, so that code runs on the infrastructure that was configured in the previous step.
