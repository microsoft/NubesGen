# What is being generated by NubesGen?

NubesGen generates a set of Terraform or Biceps configurations. If you selected the [GitOps option](https://docs.nubesgen.com/gitops/gitops-quick-start/), it will also generate a GitHub Action.

## Infrastructure as Code configuration files

NubesGen generates a `.tgz` or a `.zip`file.

Unzipping that file provides a similar structure:

```
- terraform
  |- modules
    |- app-service
      |- main.tf
      |- outputs.tf
      |- README.md
      |- variables.tf
    |- mysql
      |- main.tf
      |- outputs.tf
      |- README.md
      |- variables.tf
  |- main.tf
  |- outputs.tf
  |- README.md
  |- variables.tf
```

In this example, we have a Terraform configuration that uses two modules (App Service and MySQL), that are ready for 
deployment.

To deploy your infrastructure, all you need to do is initialize Terraform and apply its configuration:

```bash
terraform init && terraform apply -auto-approve
```

## GitHub Action

If you selected the [GitOps option](/gitops/gitops-overview), NubesGen will generate a GitHub Action for you, which will manage the Terraform
configuration automatically.

That GitHub Action is located in a hidden GitHub directory, so the file structure will look similar to this:

```
– .github
  |- workflows
    |- gitops.yml
- terraform
  |- modules
    |- app-service
      |- main.tf
      |- outputs.tf
      |- README.md
      |- variables.tf
    |- mysql
      |- main.tf
      |- outputs.tf
      |- README.md
      |- variables.tf
  |- main.tf
  |- outputs.tf
  |- README.md
  |- variables.tf
```
