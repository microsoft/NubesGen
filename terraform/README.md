## Running Terraform

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is used to automate infrastructure configuration.

As you selected the [NubesGen GitOps option](https://docs.nubesgen.com/gitops/gitops-quick-start/),
Terraform should be run by a generated GitHub Action called `gitops.yml`.

Once your Terraform configuration has been applied, you can go to the [Azure Portal](https://aka.ms/nubesgen-portal) to check your resources.
